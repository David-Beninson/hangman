 # Hangman

Hangman is a classic word guessing game created using React JS. The goal of the game is to guess the hidden word before you run out of guesses.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. You will be presented with a blank canvas and a list of letters to choose from. Select a letter to guess and if it is part of the hidden word, it will appear in its place. If not, you will lose one of your guesses. 

Good luck!
